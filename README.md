# RiceComp554TinyML-Final-Project
Following the instruction from TinyML Book and github (https://github.com/mit-han-lab/tinyml)
## Train the machine learning model
- train the wakeup word recognition model on Google Cloud
- adjust the variable for accuracy result
- copy the weight matrix
## Run a machine learning model with Arduino 
- install Arduino add-on
- write code using Arduino TinyML library
- use the weight matrix from the model we trained
## Result
- be able to detect 6+ wakeup work with 70% accuracy
